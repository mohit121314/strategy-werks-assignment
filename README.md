Project Documentation: Virtual Scrolling in React with Dynamic Data Loading.

Hosted Link for Assingnemnt :- https://mohit121314.github.io/strategy-werks-assignment/

Architectural Overview
1. React with Hooks: The main architecture is built using React's functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect).
2. React Virtualized: The react-window library is used to implement virtual scrolling, which minimizes DOM nodes and reduces rendering times for large lists.
3. SCSS for Styling: SCSS (Sass) is used for custom styling, enabling nesting, variables, and responsive design through media queries.
4. State Management: React's internal state is used for handling loaded data and dynamically loading more items.
5. Responsiveness: The layout is made responsive using fluid units, media queries, and flexible grid layouts.
6. Accessibility: Keyboard navigation and proper focus handling are considered for screen reader compatibility.
7. Error Handling: Edge cases such as slow networks or failed data fetches are handled by showing loading indicators and error messages.
